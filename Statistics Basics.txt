    Measure of linear Relationship
        Covariance, Coefficient of correlation, coefficient of determination
        Covariance - when 2 variable move in the same direction; covariance is large positive #
                     when 2 variable move in the opp direction; covariance is large negative #
                     a small covariance #, hard to say
                     the sign is imp & tells us the nature of Relationship
                     Magnitute is diff to judge - we can improve by coefficient of correlation
        Coefficient of correlation - values -1,0,+1, formula - covariance / SD( individual )
                    -1 - negative linear Relationship
                    +1 - perfect positive Relationship
                    0 - no Relationship
                    drawbacks - except for -,0,1 - we cannot imterpret the correlation
                    e.g. -0.4 - negative Relationship & its weak as 0.4 is cose to 0
                        set1 = 0.943 ( positive & close to 1 )
                        set2 = -0.943 ( negative)
                        set3 = -0.189 ( almost no Relationship)
        coefficient of determination - R^2
                    measures the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is 
                    explained by the variation int he indepedent variable
                    e.g r2 = 0.75. 75% of variation is explained by X. 25% is unexplained

General Guidelines for Exploring the data
    1) approx center of the distribution
    2) are they widely dispersed
    3) unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal, where are the peaks & valleys
    4) distribution symmetric, skewed etc.

CH5 - Data Collection & Sampling
    Data Collection - observation, surveys, experiments
    Sampling
            Cost hence sampling 
            Sampling could be biased; make sure that it represents the population in as much as 
            many aspects as possible

            Types
                1) Random Sampling - equaly likely
                2) Stratified Random Sampling
                    Obtained by seperating the population into mutually exclusive strate then simple random sampling 
                3) Cluster Sample
                     simple random sample of groups

    Error of Sampling
        Sampling error & non sampling error
        Sampling Error - error we expect to occur when we make a statement 
            about the population based on the sample statistics.
        Non Sampling Error
            1) Error in data acquisition
            2) Non response error
            3) Selection biased
