    Measure of linear Relationship
        Covariance, Coefficient of correlation, coefficient of determination
        Covariance - when 2 variable move in the same direction; covariance is large positive #
                     when 2 variable move in the opp direction; covariance is large negative #
                     a small covariance #, hard to say
                     the sign is imp & tells us the nature of Relationship
                     Magnitute is diff to judge - we can improve by coefficient of correlation
        Coefficient of correlation - values -1,0,+1, formula - covariance / SD( individual )
                    -1 - negative linear Relationship
                    +1 - perfect positive Relationship
                    0 - no Relationship
                    drawbacks - except for -,0,1 - we cannot imterpret the correlation
                    e.g. -0.4 - negative Relationship & its weak as 0.4 is cose to 0
                        set1 = 0.943 ( positive & close to 1 )
                        set2 = -0.943 ( negative)
                        set3 = -0.189 ( almost no Relationship)
        coefficient of determination - R^2
                    measures the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is 
                    explained by the variation int he indepedent variable
                    e.g r2 = 0.75. 75% of variation is explained by X. 25% is unexplained
